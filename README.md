# IDS706-mini project 9:  Cloud-Hosted Notebook Data Manipulation Project

This project demonstrates data manipulation tasks performed on a sample dataset using a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook, specifically Google Colab.

## Requirements 

1. **Setup and Configuration:** I have set up a Google Colab environment and imported the necessary libraries, including Polars for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. The code is organized into functions for ease of use.

2. **Data Manipulation Tasks:** I have performed the following data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset (class_grades.csv):

    - **Data Loading:** I used Polars to read the CSV file, 'class_grades.csv', into a DataFrame.

    - **Data Visualization:** I created a histogram to visualize the distribution of student grades and saved it as 'grades_distribution.png'.

    - **Data Analysis:** I calculated and reported statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of the dataset, and saved the results in 'desc_result.txt'.

## Usage

1. **Setup and Configuration:** Ensure you have access to a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook environment like Google Colab.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your Jupyter Notebook environment.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/cloud-hosted-notebook-project.git
    ```

3. **Run the Notebook:** Open the notebook file `cloud-hosted-notebook.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment and execute the code cells. Make sure to upload the 'class_grades.csv' file to your environment if it's not already present.

4. **View the Results:** After running the code, you can view the results in the 'grades_distribution.png' file (the grade distribution visualization) and the 'desc_result.txt' file (statistics report).

## Files

- `cloud-hosted-notebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code and documentation for this project.

- `class_grades.csv`: The sample dataset used for analysis.

- `lib/`: A directory containing utility functions for calculating statistics.

## Outputs / Results
The following is the contribution of students' grades from Jupyter Notebook:

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the setup of a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook environment, data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset, and the reporting of statistics and visualizations. Feel free to explore the notebook for a detailed walkthrough of the code and analysis.
